## Our Vision
*As we begin to transition from sheltering in place to the gradual reopening of businesses and public spaces, we aim to develop and distribute **easily scalable PPE designs** and simple safe-usage guidelines for the public in order to **protect and educate** the community.*

- We are driven by a focus on maintaining empathy, simplicity, sustainability, and accessibility in our solutions.
- Our goal is to take our PPE design through the whole development and iteration process before broadly distributing the idea.
- Our solutions should be accessible to everyone in our communities, including marginalized and under-resourced groups, and essential workers.
- We plan to collaborate with medical professionals to design the most effective homemade PPE we can, and to spread high-quality information to our community.
- We hope that our work can serve as a framework for others to use and build upon during glabal health crises now and in the future.
