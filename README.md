[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dickansj/MasterYourPPE/issues) [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1a542d0d-b04b-4aba-8f0d-5785aba0d5b9/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/masteryourppe/deploys)

> This repository contains resources for [MasterYourPPE](https://MasterYourPPE.com/), a design project aimed at developing and sharing solutions for better personal protective equipment (PPE). It is built using the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Our Vision
*As we begin to transition from sheltering in place to the gradual reopening of businesses and public spaces, we aim to develop and distribute **easily scalable PPE designs** and simple safe-usage guidelines for the public in order to **protect and educate** the community.*

- We are driven by a focus on maintaining empathy, simplicity, sustainability, and accessibility in our solutions.
- Our goal is to take our PPE designs through the development and iteration process before broadly distributing the ideas.
- Our solutions should be accessible to everyone in our communities, including marginalized and under-resourced groups, and essential workers.
- We plan to collaborate with medical professionals to design the most effective homemade PPE we can, and to spread high-quality information to our community.
- We hope that our work can serve as a framework for others to use and build upon during global health crises now and in the future.

## Getting Started
- Visit https://MasterYourPPE.com/ or our [wiki](https://github.com/dickansj/MasterYourPPE/wiki) to see our array of PPE solutions and resources for healthcare workers and the general public.

- [Contact us](https://masteryourppe.com/#contact) if you are interested in getting involved or finding out more. Have you adapted your PPE to perform better or add comfort? Let us know! We are especially interested to continue hearing from healthcare professionals to engage your experience and better understand your PPE needs.
