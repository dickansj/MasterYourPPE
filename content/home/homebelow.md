      <p class="text-left">Noting the concentration and persistence of small droplets within enclosed areas, it is very important that everyone wear a good face covering. This is to prevent droplets from accumulating in breathing spaces. And of course, itâ€™s prudent to continue to wash hands often, and to avoid crowds.</p>

      <p class="text-left">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/health/coronavirus-aerosols-indoors.html" target="_blank">latest research</a> confirms that most people become infected with Covid-19 by breathing in contaminated droplets that are ejected when talking, singing, eating, sneezing, coughing, etc.</p>
      <p class="text-left">Infectious virus particles have been observed in both, large and small droplets. Larger droplets range in size down to 0.5mm. These fall to the ground quickly usually within 6 feet of where they are generated.</p>

In still air, small droplets can accumulate in the area where they are being generated until the area becomes highly infectious.</p>
